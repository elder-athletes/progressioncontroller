Pre-Controller Runs for a week to get engagement data from the user.
Then the pointbased controller needs to be called. The engagement data haven't been implemented into the pointbased code yet.

Pre-controller future extensions:
- How many times they sit up from their chair. Then this will be used to cap the amount of time a task is recommended in a day.
- The able tags in the tasks.json needs to deactivate a task reccomendation until it is changed.

Point-Controller
- Needs to showcase the list instead of the next recommendation.
- Time tresholding using the initial engagement data
- Extend to update the frequency data and alter the task reccomendation times.
